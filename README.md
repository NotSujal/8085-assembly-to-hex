It works on string manipulation system.
Every line of code is filtered through and correct hex code is added to the queue.

It uses the starting locations to find the locations of lables.

## Flaws
Yes, it only translates the code to hexadecimal. If you want to make a runner for it you are always welcome.
Mistakes in code are very hard to find, it may lead to improper output.
